Basic Coding Tests

What began as an endeavor to create an anagram checker expanded into several basic coding tests.
This repository contains files completing the following tasks:
 * Anagram checker
 * Palindrome checker (using slice, not using slice)
 * Discover first (and kth) non-repeated character
 * List an integer's prime factors
 * Remove duplicates from a list (using set, not using set)
 * Swap numeric values without utilizing a third variable
